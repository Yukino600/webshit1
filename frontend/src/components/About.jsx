            EduElite was founded in 2020 with a simple yet powerful vision: to make 
            high-quality education accessible to learners around the world. What started 
            as a small team of educators and developers has grown into a thriving platform 
            that serves thousands of students globally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our journey began when our founder, Itsuki, recognized the need for 
            flexible, affordable, and engaging online learning solutions. With backgrounds 
            in education, technology, and business, our team came together to create a 
            platform that truly puts learners first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, always keeping our 
            core mission at the heart of everything we do: empowering individuals to 
            learn, grow, and achieve their dreams through education.
